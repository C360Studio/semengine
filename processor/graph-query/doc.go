// Package graphquery provides graph-query, the component that answers the graph.query.* verbs
// declared for it in graph.QueryVerbs. It is a thin layer over graph-ingest and graph-index: they
// hold the answers, and graph-query keeps no state of its own.
//
// The table in graph decides what it serves. Start subscribes a handler to each verb the table
// declares for graph-query and fails if one has no handler.
//
// entity, batch and prefix forward to graph-ingest's verbs of the same name, byName to graph-index's.
// A forward passes the request and reply bytes unchanged, and returns a refusal with its class, code
// and detail. A request that gets no answer is refused transient with code internal, naming the
// subject: nothing responding, query_timeout_ms passing, the handler's context ending (natsclient's
// handler budget or the client closing), or a lost connection.
//
// entityByAlias asks graph-index's alias verb, then reads the holder from graph-ingest's entity verb,
// or the input as an entity ID when nobody holds it and it is a valid one; other input is not found.
// relationships asks graph-index's outgoing or incoming verb, as direction says, and turns the rows
// into graph.RelationshipEdge. Both answer in a graph.QueryResponse from graph-query carrying the index
// reply's revision, and return any refusal unchanged.
//
// An empty configuration is enough. The one thing a configuration may set is query_timeout_ms, the
// deadline on the reply to each downstream request in milliseconds, default 15000. It does not end a
// wait to write to a broker that has stopped reading (ADR-112, "Time"). A key the configuration does
// not define is refused at construction, naming the key, and so is any input port other than the
// required graph_queries nats-request port on graph.query.*, the port an empty configuration takes.
//
// The package README.md describes its configuration, ports and health.
