# Ported from SemStreams 5457b345; uses the repo-pinned OpenSpec CLI from node_modules.
# openspec-queue.sh — surface WHY each in-flight change is still open.
#
# `openspec list` renders a change as a bare progress fraction ("12/14
# tasks"). That fraction actively misleads when the remaining work is not
# work at all but a HALT condition, a deliberate not-done, or a red gate:
# it reads "almost done, just finish it" when the honest reading is
# "decide whether this change should still exist".
#
# Three costs, all observed in SemStreams before the port (2026-08-01):
#
#   1. `[~] 4.2 NOT DONE, deliberately` in lifecycle-operator-create
#      stopped the implementer and did NOT stop the archiver. Its spec
#      delta still REQUIRED the declined behavior, and a scenario that a
#      shipped test disproves came within one command of being published
#      into openspec/specs/ as permanent current truth.
#   2. predicate-raw-key-representation's task 4.3 is a conditional HALT
#      ("if the pre-v1 wipe window closed ... re-file as a post-v1
#      migration instead of executing a second wipe"). It was invisible:
#      the word is lowercase "halt:" mid-sentence, and a purpose-built
#      case-SENSITIVE grep for it returned zero lines. A filter that
#      matches nothing on a file that contains the thing is a broken
#      filter, not a clean file — hence -i throughout below.
#   3. The program baton compensated by re-narrating these caveats every
#      session, which is both a maintenance tax and a staleness tripwire
#      that fires on changes which are correctly parked.
#
# This script reads them from the SOURCE every run, so no handoff note has to carry them and cannot drift from them.
#
# A task is read whole: its checkbox line and every line wrapped or nested
# under it, up to the next task or the next line indented no deeper than
# the task. Labels come from the checkbox line alone. A `Hold:` (matched
# with its case) anywhere in an open task's block gets one BLOCKED line,
# numbered where the hold is written, with the task number and the text
# from `Hold:` on; the checkbox line is not shown as BLOCKED a second time.
#
# Exit status is advisory-by-default and deliberately so: this is a
# reporting aid for humans and session startup, not a merge gate. Use
# --strict to exit non-zero when any caveat is found (for CI or a
# pre-archive hook). Exit 2 means the queue could not be read.
#
# --check prints no queue; `task spec:check` runs it. A `Hold:` below a
# tasks.md's first "## " heading that lies in no task's block, ticked tasks
# included, is one the queue cannot show: each is printed as <path>:<line>:
# and the exit is 1. With none it prints "holds: ok (<n> tasks.md read)" and
# exits 0. An unreadable change list or tasks.md exits 2, as for the queue.
#

#   scripts/openspec-queue.sh [--strict] [--stale-days N]

# Caveat classes, most severe first. A line matching an earlier pattern is
# reported under that class and not re-reported under a later one.
#
# These are matched ONLY against unchecked/partial task lines, because a
# COMPLETED task mentioning "blocked" is describing history, not a live
# condition — matching it would produce the noise that gets a report
# ignored, which is the failure mode this script exists to avoid.
#
# Word-boundary matching, NOT substring. The first draft used a bare
# `*fail*` glob and classified "converts a posture into a boot failure"
# as RED — SemStreams' fixture test caught it (not ported yet). Over-broad matching is not a
# harmless surplus here: a report that cries wolf on ordinary prose stops
# being read, which returns us to the invisible-caveat state this script
# exists to fix. "failure" as a noun in prose is not a red gate; "FAILED"
# and "is failing" are.
